# New World Live Map

This is a tool that shows a minimap with your live location for **New World**.

It grabs your in-game location from the location text ingame that's being displayed when enabling the *"Show FPS Counter"* option.

The **New World Live Map** shows the map using matplotlib since it has a zoom and move feature and I don't know how to code that so we will use matplotlib for now.
